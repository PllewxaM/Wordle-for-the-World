# üî† Wordle for the World üåé

## About
Welcome to World-le: the S3N1OR SQU4D‚Äôs accessible version of the popular New York Times‚Äôs word-guessing game. This game was developed in the Fall of 2022 for our CSC 355: Human Computer Interactions final project.

## Our Mission
At the start of our process, we noticed that a number of Wordle‚Äôs qualities were inaccessible. First, while versions of Wordle exist in languages other than English online, the New York Times‚Äôs game is only available in English, thereby excluding non-English speakers. Second, the color scheme is inaccessible to the color blind community; the high contrast feature is even insufficient. Additionally, there is no way for members of the Blind community to play. Finally, physical impairments deter those unable to use their hands from playing the game. 

With these shortcomings in mind, we set out to make Wordle accessible to the visually and physically impaired communities, as well as non-English speakers. We have done this by implementing a hands-free option for users to play using only their voice, as well as a language option for players to choose which language they would like play in. In addition to our accessibility features, we also added a color picker to allow users customize their gaming experience. With these implementations, we hope that this version of our World-le can truly be ‚ÄúWordle for the world.‚Äù
